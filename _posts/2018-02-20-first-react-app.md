## Demo

Check out the app using this [link](https://ryan.tk/indecision-app)

## README

This is my first app using ReactJS, the purpose of this project is to know the syntax of ES6 and ReactJS.

During the development, I learned:

1. New web application syntax
    * Setting up JSX using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as well as new ES6 features
    * Creating React components using class based stateless functional method
    * Styling the project using scss

2. Different tools for developing web apps
    * Using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage dependencies
    * Configuring the project using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
    * Integrated Third-party API (React-Modal)

3. New deployment method 
    * Deploy the app to github pages using "yarn deploy" and "gh-pages"
    ([How to deploy my react app to github pages?](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages))
    
### More details

Instead of developing React by manually configuring using webpack, react provides more convenient way by integrating webpack in 
react-scripts. Learn how to start a react app from hello-world demo, check out: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app 

Github pages can only host static pages, instead of using webpack dynamically generate bundle.js, we have to build the web first and upload
all static pages.
